    "This section is mostly for completeness, but so we will not fully dive into this topic until the sequel workshop, *Hardware Accelerated Scientific Computing* (stay tuned). However we will mention key topics for consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen an example of a *full system* that makes use of the GPU device, however we have only scratched the surface when it comes to optimizing the GPU's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that an implementation like in our example is the most optimal one, especially in cases where *a lot* of data is handled simultaneously. This mostly depends on your GPU's potential which you can check by running ```nvidia-smi``` in your terminal, however typically this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways to quantify the efficiency of your program, namely the *compute to global memory access ratio* (CGMA) which is defined as floating-point calculations : global memory access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some intuition for this: High-End GPUs today have *memory-bandwidth* supporting between 500 and 1000 GB/s. On the other hand, they support between 600 and 1300 TFLOPS, that is Terra *Floating Point Operations*. This implies that **optimal** *CGMA* ratios should hang around 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to hide latency, one which was already addressed (refer to the warps details above), and the other is to build programs with strong consideration for memory transfers/access. A memory transfer from the CPU to the GPU is inevitable, however by making use of the GPU's local resources composed of *registers* and *shared-memory*, it is possible to further reduce memory latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't dive into access patterns yet, but let's define different memory types. *Device Global Memory* is the GPU's accomadated memory, it has the most amount of memory, implemented using DDR4, it is shared amongst all threads and it is the slowest of the 3. *Device Shared Memory* is the GPU's local memory which is shared amongst threads in a block - this means that as its name implies, the memory is shared amongst these threads, and it is faster than *Device Global Memory*. *Device Local Memory* is also the GPU's local memory which is private amongst the threads in a block, it can only be accessed by its own thread and is the fastest of the memory accesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In creating kernels, these are important considerations, however libraries like CuPy (in the next section), take care of most of this for us already."
